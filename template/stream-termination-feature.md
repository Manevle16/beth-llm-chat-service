# Stream Termination Feature Implementation Plan

Use this template to outline the implementation steps for adding the ability to terminate active streaming messages. This feature will allow users to end a streaming response early while preserving the partial response in the database.

---

- [x] **1. Extend data models and types**
  - Add `StreamSession` interface to track active streaming sessions
  - Define `StreamStatus` enum (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, TERMINATED, ERROR)
  - Add `terminateStream` mutation to GraphQL schema
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-1, REQ-2_

- [x] **2. Implement core stream session manager**
  - Create `StreamSessionManager` class to handle active stream tracking
  - Include session ID generation, timeout management, and cleanup
  - Add utility methods for accessing session state and terminating streams
  - Write unit tests for this service
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-2, REQ-3_

- [x] **3. Extend storage or persistence layer**
  - Add `stream_sessions` table to track active streaming sessions
  - Ensure atomic operations for session state updates
  - Add cleanup procedures for expired sessions
  - Test persistence edge cases
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-3_

- [x] **4. Add stream termination endpoint**
  - Implement `POST /api/terminate-stream` endpoint
  - Validate session ID and conversation access permissions
  - Send termination signal to active stream and save partial response
  - Write unit tests for the termination endpoint
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-4, REQ-5_

- [x] **5. Modify existing streaming logic**
  - Update `/api/stream-message` to register with session manager
  - Integrate termination signal handling in streaming loop
  - Ensure graceful cleanup of resources on termination
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-5, REQ-6_

- [x] **6. Add GraphQL mutation for stream termination**
  - Implement `terminateStream` resolver with proper error handling
  - Add input validation and conversation access control
  - Return termination status and partial response data
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-6_

- [x] **7. Integrate with existing systems**
  - Modify OllamaService to support stream interruption
  - Ensure backwards compatibility with existing streaming endpoints
  - Add session cleanup on server startup/shutdown
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-7_

- [x] **8. Add error handling and observability**
  - Implement session timeout and automatic cleanup
  - Add detailed logging for stream termination events
  - Track metrics for termination frequency and partial response lengths
  - Test error recovery scenarios
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-8_

- [x] **9. Write integration tests**
  - Simulate full stream termination flow from start to end
  - Cover timeout, manual termination, and error scenarios
  - Verify partial response preservation and database consistency
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-9_

- [x] **10. Final integration and optimization**
  - Profile memory usage of active session tracking
  - Ensure efficient cleanup of terminated sessions
  - Validate system stability under concurrent termination requests
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-10_

## Requirements

**REQ-1**: Users must be able to terminate an active streaming response
**REQ-2**: Partial responses must be saved to the database upon termination
**REQ-3**: Terminated streams must be properly cleaned up to prevent resource leaks
**REQ-4**: Stream termination must be accessible via both REST API and GraphQL
**REQ-5**: Termination requests must validate user permissions for the conversation
**REQ-6**: The system must handle concurrent termination requests gracefully
**REQ-7**: Stream termination must not affect other active streams
**REQ-8**: Session timeouts must automatically clean up abandoned streams
**REQ-9**: Termination events must be logged for debugging and monitoring
**REQ-10**: The feature must maintain backwards compatibility with existing streaming
