# Feature Implementation Plan Template

Use this template to outline the implementation steps for a new feature. Each task should be aligned with specific requirements, tested, and documented for integration.

---

- [ ] **1. Extend data models and types**
  - Add necessary interfaces/types for new state or behavior
  - Define constants or enums relevant to the feature
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-1, REQ-2_

- [ ] **2. Implement core state/service manager**
  - Create a manager/controller class to handle feature state or lifecycle
  - Include persistence mechanisms and timers if needed
  - Add utility methods for accessing state or triggering behavior
  - Write unit tests for this service
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-2, REQ-3_

- [ ] **3. Extend storage or persistence layer**
  - Add new methods to the storage layer to handle feature state
  - Ensure atomic operations and transactional safety where needed
  - Test persistence edge cases
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-3_

- [ ] **4. Add processing engine or background handler**
  - Implement logic to process data or events related to the feature
  - Include integrations with external APIs if applicable
  - Support batching, filtering, or cutoff logic
  - Write unit tests for the processor
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-4, REQ-5_

- [ ] **5. Modify existing scheduling or control flow logic**
  - Update schedulers or workflows to respect new feature state
  - Integrate feature logic into lifecycle hooks or start-up routines
  - Ensure coordination with other active features
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-5, REQ-6_

- [ ] **6. Add user-facing commands or controls**
  - Implement UI, CLI, or command endpoints for controlling the feature
  - Validate inputs and add feedback messages
  - Use ephemeral or contextual messaging where appropriate
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-6_

- [ ] **7. Integrate with existing systems**
  - Modify listeners/events to factor in the new feature logic
  - Ensure backwards compatibility and smooth coexistence
  - Load new configurations or flags on startup
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-7_

- [ ] **8. Add error handling and observability**
  - Implement retries, fallbacks, and detailed logging
  - Track metrics for performance and correctness
  - Test error recovery scenarios
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-8_

- [ ] **9. Write integration tests**
  - Simulate full flow from start to end
  - Cover restart, failure, and recovery scenarios
  - Verify interactions and state correctness
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-9_

- [ ] **10. Final integration and optimization**
  - Profile and optimize performance bottlenecks
  - Ensure efficient resource usage in critical paths
  - Validate system stability under high load
  - _Linked Requirements: REQ-10_
