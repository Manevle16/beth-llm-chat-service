# Image Upload Feature Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines formal requirements for adding image upload support to the stream message API, enabling vision-capable models to analyze and respond to images. The feature will integrate with the existing streaming infrastructure and support models that can process visual content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Upload and Storage

**User Story:**  
As a **user**, I want to **upload images to the stream message API** so that **vision-capable models can analyze and respond to visual content**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message with an image attachment THEN the system SHALL accept and store the image file securely
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file type (PNG, JPEG, WebP) and size (max 10MB)
3. WHEN image validation passes THEN the system SHALL store the image in a designated storage location with a unique identifier
4. IF an invalid file type is uploaded THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with a clear error message
5. IF an image exceeds the size limit THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with a size limit error
6. WHEN the system stores an image THEN it SHALL maintain a reference in the database linking it to the conversation
7. IF image storage fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 2: Vision Model Integration

**User Story:**  
As a **user**, I want to **send images to vision-capable models** so that **the AI can analyze visual content and provide contextual responses**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message contains an image AND the selected model supports vision THEN the system SHALL include the image in the model request
2. WHEN a vision-capable model receives an image THEN the system SHALL format the request according to Ollama's vision API specifications
3. WHEN a non-vision model receives an image THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the model doesn't support images
4. IF the model fails to process the image THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback text-only response
5. WHEN streaming responses for vision requests THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing streaming infrastructure
6. IF image processing times out THEN the system SHALL terminate gracefully and preserve partial responses

---

### Requirement 3: Database Schema Extension

**User Story:**  
As a **system administrator**, I want to **track image uploads and their relationships** so that **conversation history includes visual context**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL create a database record linking the image to the conversation and message
2. WHEN retrieving conversation history THEN the system SHALL include image references for messages that contain images
3. WHEN a conversation is deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up associated image files and database records
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and rollback changes
5. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL validate image file integrity against database records

### Requirement 4: API Endpoint Enhancement

**User Story:**  
As a **developer**, I want to **extend the existing stream message API** so that **it can handle multipart form data with images**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/api/stream-message` endpoint receives multipart data THEN the system SHALL parse both text message and image files
2. WHEN processing multipart requests THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with text-only requests
3. WHEN an image is included in a stream request THEN the system SHALL validate the model supports vision capabilities
4. IF the request format is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with clear validation messages
5. WHEN streaming responses for image requests THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing SSE event format
6. IF image processing fails during streaming THEN the system SHALL terminate the stream gracefully

### Requirement 5: Security and Performance

**User Story:**  
As a **system administrator**, I want to **ensure secure and efficient image handling** so that **the system remains stable and protected**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL scan for malicious content and reject suspicious files
2. WHEN storing images THEN the system SHALL use secure file permissions and access controls
3. IF storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup of old images
4. WHEN processing multiple concurrent image requests THEN the system SHALL maintain performance within acceptable limits
5. IF image processing causes memory issues THEN the system SHALL implement safeguards to prevent system overload
6. WHEN the system shuts down THEN it SHALL preserve image data and maintain conversation integrity
