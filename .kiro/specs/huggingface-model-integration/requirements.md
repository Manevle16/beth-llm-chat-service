# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for Hugging Face models using the @huggingface/transformers library to the existing LLM chat service. The integration will allow users to configure, discover, and use Hugging Face models alongside existing Ollama models through the same API endpoints. The feature maintains consistency with existing patterns while extending the service's model capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure a local path for storing Hugging Face models, so that the service can manage and access these models efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read a configurable path for Hugging Face model storage from the configuration
2. IF no path is configured THEN the system SHALL use a default path of './models/huggingface'
3. WHEN the configured path does not exist THEN the system SHALL create the directory structure automatically
4. WHEN the path is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL log an error and fall back to the default path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve all available Hugging Face models through the existing get models API, so that I can present users with a unified list of available models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to the models endpoint THEN the response SHALL include both Ollama and Hugging Face models
2. WHEN listing Hugging Face models THEN the system SHALL scan the configured storage path for available models
3. WHEN a Hugging Face model is found THEN it SHALL be returned with metadata including model name, type, and source identifier
4. WHEN no Hugging Face models are available THEN the API SHALL still return successfully with an empty Hugging Face models array
5. WHEN the Hugging Face models directory is inaccessible THEN the system SHALL log a warning and return only Ollama models

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to use Hugging Face models in the stream-message API by specifying the model name, so that I can generate responses using Hugging Face models seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stream-message request specifies a Hugging Face model THEN the system SHALL route the request to the Hugging Face service
2. WHEN using a Hugging Face model THEN the response SHALL maintain the same streaming format as Ollama models
3. WHEN a Hugging Face model is not found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a Hugging Face model fails to load THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and return a meaningful error response
5. WHEN switching between Ollama and Hugging Face models THEN the system SHALL maintain session consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Hugging Face integration to follow existing service patterns, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Hugging Face support THEN it SHALL follow the same service architecture patterns as existing model services
2. WHEN adding database interactions THEN it SHALL use existing database service patterns or extend them appropriately
3. WHEN handling errors THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing error handling service
4. WHEN logging events THEN it SHALL use consistent logging patterns with existing services
5. WHEN managing model state THEN it SHALL integrate with or extend the existing model state tracking system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want proper error handling and logging for Hugging Face operations, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Hugging Face model operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN model loading takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeout handling
3. WHEN memory usage is high during model operations THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing memory monitoring
4. WHEN concurrent requests use Hugging Face models THEN the system SHALL handle resource contention appropriately
5. WHEN the @huggingface/transformers library encounters errors THEN the system SHALL translate them into user-friendly messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a client application, I want model rotation to work with Hugging Face models, so that I can benefit from load balancing and failover capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model rotation is configured THEN it SHALL include Hugging Face models in the rotation pool
2. WHEN a Hugging Face model in rotation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the next available model
3. WHEN tracking model performance THEN the system SHALL collect metrics for Hugging Face models
4. WHEN balancing load THEN the system SHALL consider Hugging Face model resource requirements
5. WHEN updating rotation configuration THEN it SHALL support adding and removing Hugging Face models dynamically
