# Hugging Face Integration Feature Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines formal requirements for adding Hugging Face LLM model support to the beth-llm-chat-service using the transformers package. The feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing stream-message API, append Hugging Face models to the available model list, and redirect Hugging Face model requests to the appropriate implementation while maintaining compatibility with existing Ollama models.

---

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hugging Face Model Registration and Discovery

**User Story:**  
As a **developer or admin**, I want to add support for Hugging Face LLM models (via the transformers package) so that users can select and use these models in the same way as existing Ollama models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL detect and register available Hugging Face models (configurable via environment or config file)
2. WHEN a client requests the model list (e.g., via the `availableModels` GraphQL query) THEN the system SHALL append Hugging Face models to the returned list, alongside Ollama models
3. IF a Hugging Face model is selected for a conversation or message THEN the system SHALL route the request to the Hugging Face/transformers backend for inference
4. IF a model is not available in either Ollama or Hugging Face THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
5. WHEN a Hugging Face model is used in the `/stream-message` API THEN the streaming and response format SHALL remain consistent with existing models

---

### Requirement 2: Seamless User Experience Integration

**User Story:**  
As a **user**, I want to use Hugging Face models seamlessly in the chat interface so that I can interact with them just like with Ollama models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Hugging Face model is selected in the UI THEN messages sent SHALL be processed by the Hugging Face backend
2. WHEN streaming responses from a Hugging Face model THEN the system SHALL maintain the same event and token streaming protocol as for Ollama models
3. IF a Hugging Face model supports vision or multimodal input THEN the system SHALL process images and metadata as with other models (if supported by the model)
4. WHEN switching between Ollama and Hugging Face models THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation continuity and context
5. IF a Hugging Face model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to available models or provide clear error messaging

---

### Requirement 3: Modular Architecture and Extensibility

**User Story:**  
As a **developer**, I want the Hugging Face integration to be modular and maintainable so that future model providers can be added with minimal changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new model provider THEN the system SHALL use a provider-agnostic interface for model inference and listing
2. IF a new provider is added THEN the `/stream-message` API and model listing logic SHALL require minimal or no changes to support it
3. WHEN the Hugging Face service is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the same interface patterns as the existing OllamaService
4. IF the transformers package is updated THEN the system SHALL handle version compatibility gracefully
5. WHEN model configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload configurations without requiring a full restart

---

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:**  
As a **system operator**, I want errors and exceptions from Hugging Face models to be logged and reported clearly so that I can diagnose issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF a Hugging Face model inference fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with details and return a user-friendly error message to the client
2. WHEN a Hugging Face model is unavailable or misconfigured THEN the system SHALL not impact the availability of Ollama models
3. IF the transformers package encounters memory issues THEN the system SHALL implement safeguards to prevent system overload
4. WHEN Hugging Face model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for debugging
5. IF model inference times out THEN the system SHALL terminate gracefully and preserve partial responses
6. WHEN monitoring Hugging Face model performance THEN the system SHALL track metrics similar to Ollama models

---

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Continuity

**User Story:**  
As a **user**, I want the system to preserve conversation and message continuity regardless of the model provider so that my experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is restarted THEN it SHALL preserve the mapping of conversations to their selected model (Ollama or Hugging Face)
2. IF a conversation uses a Hugging Face model THEN all subsequent messages in that conversation SHALL continue to use the same model unless changed by the user
3. WHEN retrieving conversation history THEN the system SHALL maintain the model provider information for each message
4. IF a Hugging Face model becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL preserve conversation data and allow switching to available models
5. WHEN migrating conversations between model providers THEN the system SHALL maintain message integrity and context
