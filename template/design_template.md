# Design Document Template

## Overview

This feature implements a delayed processing mechanism. It observes input events, temporarily stores them, and processes them after a fixed delay. The system is designed with modular components and reliable state recovery mechanisms.

---

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with separation of concerns across services:

- **Event Handler**: Subscribes to input events (e.g., messages, tasks) and triggers initial processing
- **Storage Service**: Persists pending actions to ensure recovery after restart
- **Scheduler Service**: Manages timing for deferred processing
- **Processor/Handler Service**: Executes main logic (e.g., forwarding, transformation)
- **Configuration Service**: Loads runtime settings and validates them

---

## Components and Interfaces

### EventListener


interface EventListener {
  onInputEvent(data: EventData): Promise<void>;
}


- Subscribes to incoming events
- Filters relevant items
- Delegates to the scheduler or processor

---

### SchedulerService

interface SchedulerService {
  schedule(data: InputItem): Promise<void>;
  processDueItems(): Promise<void>;
  restoreScheduledItems(): Promise<void>;
}

- Tracks delay windows (e.g., 15 minutes)
- Schedules actions
- Triggers execution when due

---

### ProcessorService

interface ProcessorService {
  process(item: StoredItem): Promise<boolean>;
  handleFailure(itemId: string): Promise<void>;
}


- Executes business logic on stored items
- Logs and recovers from partial failures

---

### StorageService


interface StorageService {
  save(item: StoredItem): Promise<void>;
  getAll(): Promise<StoredItem[]>;
  remove(id: string): Promise<void>;
}


- Ensures persistence across system restarts
- Supports simple CRUD for scheduled data

---

### ConfigurationService


interface ConfigurationService {
  getSetting(key: string): string;
  isFeatureEnabled(): boolean;
}


- Provides runtime configuration
- Validates required parameters

---

## Data Models


interface StoredItem {
  id: string;
  payload: any;
  createdAt: Date;
  scheduledTime: Date;
}



interface EventData {
  sourceId: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}


---

## Error Handling

- **Permission Errors**: Log and degrade gracefully
- **Storage Failures**: Retry with backoff, backup when needed
- **Execution Errors**: Log and mark as failed
- **Missing Configuration**: Disable feature with error message

---

## Recovery Mechanisms

- Persistent storage ensures restart continuity
- Periodic checks recover missed events
- Retry logic handles transient failures

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Scheduler timing logic
- Storage operations
- Processor error recovery
- Configuration validation

### Integration Testing

- Full lifecycle from input to output
- Restart recovery
- Error path simulation

### Manual Testing

- Real input verification
- Delay accuracy check
- Restart scenarios

---

## Implementation Notes

- Use `setTimeout` or cron-like polling for delay management
- Store absolute timestamps for reliable reloading
- Use atomic writes for file-based storage
- Ensure resilience under API rate limits and misconfigurations

---

## Environment Configuration

Environment variables:

- `INPUT_SOURCE_ID`
- `DESTINATION_ID`
- `PROCESS_DELAY_MS`

Validate all config at startup, and fail gracefully if missing.

## 🧠 LLM Prompting Tips

Use this template in combination with the following workflow to maximize usefulness in LLM-based IDEs like Cursor:

1. **Start with the Feature Spec Template**  
   Describe high-level tasks in checklist format with implementation goals.

2. **Follow with the Requirements Template**  
   Define multiple requirements and acceptance criteria for each feature.

3. **Then Generate Requirements via LLM**  
   Let the LLM convert feature spec into concrete requirements using the template format.

4. **Use This Design Template to Elaborate**  
   Generate a design document based on the generated requirements.

5. **Finally, Let LLM Derive Implementation Plan**  
   Ask the LLM to generate a dev-ready implementation spec or code based on this design doc.

---

## ✅ Prompting Suggestions

- “Based on this feature spec and these requirements, generate a design document using the template format.”
- “What components and data models would this feature need?”
- “Can you write a SchedulerService interface with recovery in mind?”
- “Now generate an implementation plan for the above design.”

> 💡 Be specific in prompts (e.g., "use TypeScript" or "assume Discord.js v14").
> 🧩 Customize interface names and error cases to match your domain.
> 🧪 Always test assumptions through integration or manual tests post
